Lesson learnt:

First design the end result page, or something
so that you will not have to make many changes at the end.
For example: In hireup case, resume design was created at the end, which result in many addition of column,
			 and even table such as skills table.

Make sure if user is doing process => forget password, 
now, here user enter his username and email, and after click on continue,
session is created with name 'username', but this same session name is used after user login,
so define alternative session name such as uname to avoid this issue


NOTE: Create shorter name for file (java, html, css, js, jsp, images-files or any file)
      Since, it may be an issue that system may not able to copy the file, or fetch file detail due to extend of path limit


1. create one more column in login table, with name 'Profile-Status enum(Complete, Incomplete) default value = Incomplete'
   * check this validation at each page when user is visiting, 
   * if profile-status = complete, let user see and work on the request page
   * if profile-status = incomplete, then force user to complete it (in HireUp case, redirect to JSP/User/UserLoginAction.jsp

   


Future work:
1. Resume download in color format
2. File and Image upload
3. Download Multiple Resume of selected user
4. Filter feature for admin

6. Additing validation, in admin view student records page, such that, only users who has fill all the details, that users records should be visible only
